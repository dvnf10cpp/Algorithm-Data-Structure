## Learning Algorithm and Data Structure

1. [Freecodecamp Data Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B31LgI4Y4DQ) ```C/C++```
2. [Freecodecamp Pointer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M) ```C/C++```

## Concepts

1. #### [Pointers](./src/Pointers/README.md) (for C/C++ language)

## Scripts
1. run.sh : to instant compile cpp or c file and put in out dir. Takes 2 parameters, first is the dir inside src and second is the file that has cpp or c extension inside the dir.  
How to use : just run ```chmod +x ./run.sh``` first. make sure your terminal is bash
Example    : ```./run.sh Pointers main``` in cli
